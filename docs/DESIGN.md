# DecDVB — Design

A Rust **DVB-S2 / DVB-S2X** receiver with **ACM** (Adaptive Coding & Modulation), **GSE** de-encapsulation to **IP (PCAP)**, **TS** extraction, and a matching **modulator** for loopback and ACM test-signal generation. HackRF One based, with IQ-file replay.

Status date: 2026-10-08 (kickoff). This document is the source of truth for scope and milestones — read it before continuing work. Decisions here come from the kickoff Q&A with Rory.

---

## 1. Goals & non-goals

**Goals**
- Receive and decode DVB-S2 and DVB-S2X signals that fit a HackRF One (symbol rate up to ~15 MS/s; practically 125 kS–10 MS/s is the sweet spot).
- Full **ACM/VCM**: demodulate each PLFRAME at whatever MODCOD its PLHEADER declares, frame by frame, with no prior knowledge.
- De-encapsulate **GSE** → reassemble **IPv4/IPv6** → write **PCAP** + show live stream stats. Handle the proprietary GSE variants real operators use (see §6).
- Extract **TS-mode** BBFRAMEs → `.ts` (most amateur DATV is still TS).
- A **modulator** (TX) that produces spec-correct S2/S2X signals (HackRF TX or IQ file) so we can generate ACM/GSE test signals and run end-to-end loopback — real ACM/GSE captures are scarce.
- egui/glow GUI + CLI, same look/feel as DecDRM. Portable exes + GitHub releases + CI.

**Non-goals (for now)**
- Channel bonding (S2X Annex D) and wideband / time-slicing (Annex M) — need multiple tuners or >20 MHz; file-only if ever.
- Full two-way ACM link with a return channel (we build the pieces — RX SNR estimate + TX per-frame MODCOD — but not the closed loop over a radio return path now).
- Conditional access / descrambling of encrypted payloads. We decode the transport, not break crypto.
- Formal DVB certification. "Compliant" here = matches the normative bit/symbol processing and verifies against reference vectors for everything a HackRF can receive.

**Targets:** QO-100 & amateur DATV; narrow Ku/C SCPC/VSAT IP carriers; wide broadcast muxes (file replay only — too wide for HackRF live); own HackRF TX later.

## 2. Signal chain (RX)

```
HackRF / IQ file
  → AGC + DC/IQ-balance
  → resample to N samples/symbol
  → matched filter (RRC, roll-off from PLHEADER search / config)
  → timing recovery (Gardner)
  → coarse+fine carrier frequency & phase recovery
  → PL sync: SOF correlation (25 symbols) + PLS code decode (64→7 bits)  → MODCOD, FECFRAME type, pilots?
  → pilot-aided phase tracking
  → PL descramble (gold code, index from config/search)
  → de-map to soft bits (LLRs) for the declared MODCOD
  → LDPC decode (DVB-S2/S2X H-matrices; normal 64800 / short 16200 / medium 32400)
  → BCH decode (outer)
  → BBFRAME  → BBHEADER parse (CRC-8) → MATYPE (TS/GS, SIS/MIS, CCM/ACM, ISSYI, NPD, RO), DFL, SYNC, UPL …
      ├─ GS (generic stream) → GSE de-encapsulation → reassembly → IP → PCAP + stats
      └─ TS (transport)      → TS reassembly (incl. CRC variants) → .ts
```

ACM/VCM is inherent: every PLFRAME carries its own MODCOD in the PLHEADER, so the demod re-selects constellation + LDPC rate per frame. VCM = fixed set over streams; ACM = time-varying; same code path.

## 3. Signal chain (TX / modulator)

Mirror of RX: input bytes (TS, or GSE-encapsulated IP, or BBFRAME) → BBHEADER + CRC-8 → BB scrambling → BCH encode → LDPC encode → bit interleave → map to constellation → PL framing (SOF + PLS + pilots) → PL scramble → RRC pulse shape → resample → HackRF TX / IQ file. Used for loopback tests and ACM test-signal sequences (script a MODCOD schedule).

## 3a. Application shape: wideband waterfall + VFOs

Decided 2026-10-08, at Rory's request: the app works like **SDR++**, not like a
single-carrier decoder. This shapes the engine, so it lands before the FEC work.

```
IqSource (HackRF 20 MS/s, or a wideband file)
  │
  ├─► wideband FFT ──► spectrum + scrolling waterfall (the whole span)
  │
  ├─► carrier detector ──► candidate carriers marked on the waterfall
  │
  └─► ring buffer ──┬─► VFO 1: DDC (NCO mix + decimate) ─► decoder ─► output
                    ├─► VFO 2: DDC ─► decoder ─► output
                    └─► VFO n: …                    (one worker thread each)
```

- A **VFO** is a centre frequency, a bandwidth and a chosen decoder. Drop one by
  dragging on the waterfall, or by clicking a detected carrier (which sizes it
  correctly for you). Several decode at once, one worker thread each, with a CPU
  meter per VFO and an enable/disable that does not delete it.
- **Carrier detection** sweeps the band estimator (§ `decdvb-engine::estimate`)
  across the span and marks each candidate with its centre and estimated symbol
  rate. The estimate is good to a few percent, which is close enough to seed a
  VFO.
- **Layout**: combined spectrum + waterfall filling the top of the window, a
  side bar listing the VFOs, and the selected VFO's decoder settings,
  constellation and statistics below it.

### Decoders a VFO can run

| Decoder | What it does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Identify** ("what is this?") | Blind: measures symbol rate and roll-off, estimates constellation order, and identifies the standard. See §3b. | nothing beyond M1 |
| **DVB-S2/S2X → GSE/IP** | Full ACM demod → LDPC/BCH → GSE → IP → PCAP + stream stats | M2–M4 |
| **DVB-S2/S2X → MPEG-TS** | Same demod, TS-mode BBFRAMEs → `.ts` or UDP | M2, Appendix C |
| **Generic PSK → symbols** | Any linearly modulated carrier: blind rate, carrier lock, hard decisions to a `.bin`, one byte per symbol | done |
| **IQ recorder** | That VFO's narrowband IQ to a file | M1 |
| **Spectrum only** | Zoomed spectrum, level, occupied bandwidth; no decode | done |

## 3b. "What is this?" — the Identify decoder

Drag a VFO over an unknown carrier and it reports what it can. Deliberately
split into what can be known for certain and what can only be guessed, because
over-claiming here would be worse than useless.

**Measured (no standard assumed):**
- **Symbol rate.** Seeded by the equivalent-noise-bandwidth estimate (exact for
  a root-raised-cosine spectrum at any roll-off), then refined by *spectral
  self-correlation*: a linearly modulated signal with excess bandwidth
  (α > 0) has correlated spectral components exactly `Rs` apart, so
  `C(ν) = Σ_f X(f)·conj(X(f−ν))` peaks at `ν = Rs`. Finally polished by
  maximising a timing-error metric over candidate rates.
- **Roll-off**, as occupied bandwidth / Rs − 1, snapped to the legal S2/S2X set
  {0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05}.
- **Constellation order**, from the amplitude histogram: counting rings
  separates QPSK / 8PSK / 16APSK / 32APSK without decoding anything.

**Identified with certainty:**
- **DVB-S2 / S2X.** Run [`PlHeaderCorrelator`]: a PLHEADER correlation peak
  repeating at exactly the spacing the decoded PLS code predicts is a very
  strong signature — a 90-symbol known pattern recurring on a predicted grid.
  That also yields the MODCOD, FECFRAME length, pilots, and whether the frame
  is a dummy. S2X-only features (VL-SNR header, superframing) separate S2X
  from S2.

**Reported as a guess, labelled as one:**
- Anything with no PLHEADER. QPSK with no PLHEADER peak is *consistent with*
  DVB-S, but confirming it needs Viterbi plus the 204-byte RS frame sync, which
  DecDVB does not implement; the UI will say "QPSK, no DVB-S2 PLHEADER —
  possibly DVB-S" and not pretend otherwise.
- Unrecognised signals get their measured parameters and an explicit "does not
  match DVB-S2/S2X", which is honest and still useful.
- A CW tone or an empty band is called out from the band estimate alone (very
  narrow with a high peak-to-floor, or nothing above the floor).

## 5. FEC — the heavy part

- **LDPC**: DVB-S2 (EN 302 307-1) + S2X (EN 302 307-2) parity-check matrices. Frame lengths 64800 (normal), 16200 (short), 32400 (S2X medium). Rates from 1/4 … 9/10 (S2) plus the many S2X rates (e.g. 13/45, 9/20, 11/20, 26/45, 28/45, 23/36, 25/36, 13/18, 90/180 …). Layered/min-sum decoder with normalized min-sum, a few iterations, early-stop on BCH/parity. Port structure + the rate tables from **gr-dvbs2rx** / **leansdr** (GPL-3), re-expressed in Rust.
- **BCH**: outer code, t = 8/10/12 correctable, GF(2^16)/(2^14)/(2^15) per frame length.
- **Interleaver**: column-twist bit interleaver for 8PSK+ (S2) and the S2X variants.
- **Demapper**: Gray-mapped QPSK/8PSK, and the APSK ring constellations (16/32/64/128/256APSK) with the ring ratios γ per MODCOD from the spec tables; soft LLRs (approx-LLR with per-ring scaling). pi/2-BPSK for VL-SNR.

Verification: compare our encode→decode and demap/LLR against vectors generated by gr-dtv (TX) and gr-dvbs2rx (RX) for each MODCOD. Reference clones are git-ignored; vectors are generated locally (CI can regenerate small ones or carry committed golden vectors that contain no third-party code).

## 6. GSE / IP (the headline feature, per dontlookup)

After BBFRAMEs exist, GS-mode payload is GSE. Implement:
- Standard GSE (EN 301 545 / TS 102 606): Start/End fragment flags, 1-byte vs no fragment-id, length field, LT (label type) 6B/3B/broadcast/reuse, PROTOCOL-TYPE / extension headers, total-length + CRC-32 on reassembly.
- **Proprietary variants** (from dontlookup, MIT): (a) non-standard **2-byte header-length** field (`hdrlen-2`); (b) **split fragment-id** = 6-bit frag-id + 2-bit counter instead of 8-bit. → run the 4 combinations and let the user/validator pick the one that yields valid IP (IP-header checksum + sane lengths).
- **Blind IP search** fallback: scan BBFRAME payload byte offsets for an IPv4 header whose checksum validates (dontlookup's approach) when framing is unknown; also a byte-pair-swap pass.
- Reassemble fragments per frag-id → IP datagram → **PCAP** (DLT_RAW or DLT_EN10MB with a synthetic MAC) + live stats (per src/dst, protocol, pps, bps). TS-mode handled in `decdvb-ts`.

## 7. Input / output

- **Input:** HackRF live via `libhackrf` FFI (preferred; a `libhackrf.dll` is already present on this PC) — optionally SoapySDR later. IQ files: HackRF `cs8` (int8 I/Q), `cs16`, `cf32`. Center-freq / sample-rate / gain in config; LNB LO offset handling for Ku.
- **Output:** `.pcap` for IP; `.ts` for transport; GUI panels; CSV/JSON metrics.

## 8. Platform, build, release

- Windows 11 primary, Linux x86_64 too. egui/eframe with the **glow** (OpenGL) renderer (as DecDRM — keeps the Rust-version floor sane). `rustfft` for DSP.
- Portable static-CRT exes in `exe/` + attached to GitHub releases; CI on GitHub Actions (Linux+Windows tests, clippy, smoke); release.yml drafts portable exes from a pushed tag. See memory [[feedback-release-and-ci]].
- Repo: planned public `CasualArclamp/DecDVB`, **GPL-3.0-or-later**. Commit identity `Arclamp <45412977+CasualArclamp@users.noreply.github.com>`.

## 9. Milestones

- **M0 — skeleton**: workspace builds; core types + MODCOD/FECFRAME tables; config; IQ-file + HackRF source; CLI prints samples; GUI shows raw IQ constellation + spectrum. CI green. *(local git; create public repo at end of M0/M1.)*
- **M1 — acquisition & PL**: RRC + timing (Gardner) + carrier recovery; SOF/PLS correlation; PLHEADER decode (MODCOD, FECFRAME, pilots); PL descramble; pilot phase tracking. Output: locks on a signal, prints MODCOD per frame, clean constellation. *(Done 2026-10-08.)*
- **M1b — wideband + VFOs + Identify** *(added 2026-10-08, see §3a/§3b)*: DDC (NCO mix + decimating filter) and AGC; engine restructured into a wideband front end feeding N VFO worker threads behind a `Decoder` trait; carrier detection across the span; the **Identify** decoder (symbol rate, roll-off, constellation order, DVB-S2/S2X identification); an S2 PLFRAME generator in `synth` so all of it can be tested on realistic signals; GUI rebuilt around a big spectrum + waterfall with draggable VFOs and a side bar; live HackRF. Needs no FEC, so it lands first and is usable on its own as a carrier survey tool.
- **M2 — FEC core**: demap→LLR + LDPC + BCH for the common MODCODs (QPSK/8PSK, normal+short); BBHEADER + CRC-8; emit valid BBFRAMEs. Verified vs reference vectors.
- **M3 — full MODCOD coverage**: 16/32/64/128/256APSK, all S2 + S2X rates, medium frame, VL-SNR + pi/2-BPSK.
- **M4 — GSE → IP → PCAP + TS**: standard + proprietary GSE variants, reassembly, PCAP + live stats; TS-mode extraction. (Headline.)
- **M5 — S2X framing & ACM polish**: superframe (Annex E), multistream/ISI filtering, gold-code index, ACM/VCM across changing MODCODs, SNR estimate per frame.
- **M6 — modulator (TX)**: full encode chain → HackRF TX / IQ file; scripted ACM MODCOD schedules; end-to-end loopback test.
- **M7 — GUI polish + release**: stream table, ACM timeline, per-MODCOD constellation, throughput; portable exe + first public release.

## 10. Testing

- Unit tests per crate (FEC encode↔decode round trips, GSE reassembly, CRC, mapper/demapper symmetry).
- Golden vectors (committed, self-generated — no third-party source in the repo) for LDPC/BCH/mapping.
- Loopback: modulator → demodulator in-process and over a HackRF TX→RX cable, across MODCODs and roll-offs.
- Live: Rory tests against QO-100 / real carriers himself. Keep heavy sweeps on CI.

## Appendix A — where to look in the reference code

Clones live in `reference/` (git-ignored). `gr-dvbs2rx`'s `lib/` maps almost
one-to-one onto our crates, so each milestone knows where to read first:

| Our crate / milestone | gr-dvbs2rx files |
|---|---|
| `decdvb-dsp` timing (M1) | `symbol_sync_cc_impl.cc`, `delay_line.h` |
| `decdvb-dsp` carrier (M1) | `pl_freq_sync.cc/.h`, `rotator_cc_impl.cc` |
| `decdvb-frame` PL sync (M1) | `pl_frame_sync.cc/.h`, `plsync_cc_impl.cc` |
| `decdvb-frame` PLS decode (M1) | `pl_signaling.cc`, `reed_muller.cc` — the 64-bit PLS code is a **Reed–Muller** code |
| `decdvb-frame` descramble (M1) | `pl_descrambler.cc`, `pl_defs.h` |
| `decdvb-fec` demap/LLR (M2–M3) | `xfecframe_demapper_cb_impl.cc`, `qpsk.h`, `psk.hh`, `qam.hh`, `pi2_bpsk.cc` |
| `decdvb-fec` LDPC (M2–M3) | `ldpc_decoder_bb_impl.cc`, `dvb_s2_tables.hh` (55 KB), `dvb_s2x_tables.hh` (131 KB) |
| `decdvb-fec` BCH (M2) | `bch.cc`, `gf.cc`, `gf_util.h`, `reed_solomon_error_correction.hh` |
| `decdvb-fec` params (M2) | `fec_params.cc` — K/N per MODCOD |
| `decdvb-frame` BBHEADER (M2) | `bbdeheader_bb_impl.cc`, `bbdescrambler_bb_impl.cc`, `crc.h` |

`leansdr`'s `dvbs2.h` is the compact alternative worth comparing for
acquisition behaviour at low SNR. `gr-dtv` is the modulator reference for M6.

Those directories are untrusted downloaded code: read them, never build or run
them as part of DecDVB's own test loop.

## Appendix B — GSE wire format

Recorded here so M4 does not have to re-derive it. Cross-checked against the
Kaitai definitions in `dontlookup/parser/parsers/gse/*.ksy` (MIT) and ETSI
TS 102 606.

Every GSE packet starts with a 2-byte header, big-endian bit order:

```
 bit  15 14 | 13 12 | 11 ........ 0
      S  E  |  LT   |  GSE_LENGTH (12 bits)
```

`S`/`E` taken together as a 2-bit value:

| value | name   | S | E | meaning                   |
|-------|--------|---|---|---------------------------|
| 0     | middle | 0 | 0 | a middle fragment         |
| 1     | end    | 0 | 1 | the last fragment         |
| 2     | start  | 1 | 0 | the first fragment        |
| 3     | whole  | 1 | 1 | an unfragmented PDU       |

`LT` (label type): `0` = 6-byte label, `1` = 3-byte label, `2` = broadcast (no
label), `3` = re-use the previous label.

**Padding:** `S/E == middle (0b00)` *and* `LT == 0b00` *and* `GSE_LENGTH == 0`
means the rest of the BBFRAME data field is padding — stop parsing the frame.

Body by type (all after the 2-byte header):

| type   | fields                                                                   |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| start  | `frag_id` u8, `total_length` u16, `protocol_type` u16, label (6/3/0 B), data |
| middle | `frag_id` u8, data                                                       |
| end    | `frag_id` u8, data, `crc32` u32 (last 4 bytes)                           |
| whole  | `protocol_type` u16, label (6/3/0 B), data                                |

Note that **whole** carries no `frag_id` and no CRC, and **middle**/**end**
carry no protocol type or label — those come from the matching *start*
fragment, keyed by `frag_id`.

### The four variants to try

Two independent deviations, so four parsers, exactly as dontlookup does. Run
them all and accept whichever yields a valid IP header (checksum + sane
lengths):

1. **Length meaning.** *Standard*: `GSE_LENGTH` counts every byte after the
   2-byte header. *`hdrlen`*: `GSE_LENGTH` counts the **PDU only**, excluding
   the frag-id / total-length / protocol-type / label fields that follow it.
2. **Fragment id.** *Standard*: `frag_id` is a plain u8. *`split`*: that byte is
   a 6-bit `frag_id` plus a 2-bit continuity counter.

A fifth, `hdrlen_unsafe`, is `hdrlen` that also ignores `LT` — more permissive,
accepting packets a label-type check would discard. Worth having as a last
resort.

### Fallbacks when framing is unknown

- **Blind IPv4 search**: scan every byte offset of the BBFRAME data field for a
  header whose IHL, total length and checksum all agree.
- **Byte-pair swap**: some captures arrive 16-bit byte-swapped; re-run the
  parsers over a pair-swapped copy.

## Appendix C — TS mode

TS-mode BBFRAMEs carry 188-byte MPEG-TS packets with the sync byte replaced per
the BBHEADER's `SYNC`/`SYNCD` fields, and optional null-packet deletion (NPD).
dontlookup also implements two CRC variants seen in the wild — "Generic" and
"Newtec" — which `decdvb-ts` should offer alongside the standard handling.
