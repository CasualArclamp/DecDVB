# Status

Running log of what is done and what is next. `docs/DESIGN.md` holds the plan.

## M0 — skeleton (done, 2026-10-08)

Workspace builds clean, tests and clippy green.

- `decdvb-core` — `Modulation`, `CodeRate`, `FecFrame`, `Modcod` + the 28
  standard DVB-S2 MODCODs; `RollOff` (0.35…0.05); `SampleFormat` (cs8/cs16/cf32)
  and IQ byte conversion; `RxConfig`, `Metrics`, `Error`.
- `decdvb-io` — `IqSource` trait, `IqFileReader` / `IqFileWriter`, extension
  sniffing. HackRF front end scaffolded behind the `hackrf` feature (loads
  `libhackrf` at run time in M1, so no SDK is needed to build).
- `decdvb-dsp` — root-raised-cosine taps (unit energy, singularities handled)
  and a streaming complex FIR.
- `decdvb-engine` — `Spectrum` (Hann, 50 % overlap, averaged, FFT-shifted) and
  `estimate_band`: carrier centre, 99 % occupied bandwidth, noise floor, and a
  **symbol-rate estimate from the equivalent noise bandwidth** — exact for a
  root-raised-cosine signal regardless of roll-off (see the doc comment).
- `decdvb-cli` — `modcods`, `analyse`, and `synth` (a shaped QPSK test-signal
  generator with frequency offset and Es/N0; not a DVB-S2 modulator, that is M6).
- `decdvb-gui` — eframe/glow window: open a capture, spectrum and constellation.
- CI on GitHub Actions: Linux + Windows build/test, clippy, rustfmt, and a build
  with the `hackrf` feature to prove it compiles with no SDR attached.
- Stub crates in place for `fec`, `frame`, `gse`, `ts`, `ip`, `mod`.

Verified by hand: `synth` then `analyse` recovers the carrier offset and symbol
rate of signals at 125 kS/s–1 MS/s with roll-offs 0.05–0.35.

## M1 — acquisition and PL sync (in progress)

### Done: the PLHEADER (`decdvb-frame`)

The 90-symbol PLHEADER is fully implemented and tested — this is the part that
makes ACM possible at all, since every PLFRAME announces its own MODCOD.

- `defs` — PLFRAME geometry (SOF 26, PLSC 64, slot 90, pilot block 36 every
  16 slots), the SOF pattern and the PLS scrambler.
- `pi2bpsk` — pi/2-BPSK map, coherent hard/soft demap, and **differential**
  demap for use before carrier lock.
- `rm` — the interleaved **(64, 7, 32) Reed–Muller** code the PLS code is
  protected by, with hard (Hamming) and soft (max-inner-product) decoding. The
  soft path folds descrambling into the codeword table. Tests confirm minimum
  distance 32 and correction of any 15-bit error pattern.
- `plsc` — `PlsInfo`: MODCOD, FECFRAME length, pilots, and the frame geometry
  they imply (slots, pilot blocks, XFECFRAME and PLFRAME lengths). A test
  checks `slots × 90 × bits_per_symbol` equals the FECFRAME length for all 28
  MODCODs in both frame lengths, so the geometry cannot silently drift.
- `sync` — `PlHeaderCorrelator`, differential correlation against SOF (25 taps)
  plus PLSC (32 taps). The PLSC taps come from the **scrambler alone**: the
  interleaved Reed–Muller construction makes each consecutive codeword bit pair
  either equal or opposite, so the pairwise differential is fixed up to a 180°
  flip that `max(|SOF+PLSC|, |SOF-PLSC|)` resolves. So the correlator finds a
  PLHEADER without knowing its PLS code, and — being differential — works at
  frequency offsets up to at least 1 % of the symbol rate. Verified: correct
  peak position for all 32 MODCODs, under noise, and under offset.

### Still to do

1. Live HackRF source (`libloading` over `libhackrf`), cs8 at up to ~20 MS/s.
2. Fractional resampler, AGC, DC/IQ-imbalance correction.
3. Gardner timing recovery; coarse (FFT) + fine (PLL) carrier recovery.
4. The lock state machine: searching → found → locked, predicting the next SOF
   from `PlsInfo::plframe_len`.
5. PL descrambling (gold code), pilot-aided phase tracking.
6. Output: holds lock on a real signal and prints the MODCOD of every PLFRAME.
