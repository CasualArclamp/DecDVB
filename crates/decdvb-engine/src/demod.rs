//! Streaming DVB-S2 physical-layer demodulator: VFO baseband in, PLFRAMEs out.
//!
//! matched filter → AGC → Gardner timing → PLHEADER correlation → frame lock →
//! PLS decode → payload descrambling.
//!
//! **Frame lock.** A PLFRAME is only emitted once the *next* PLHEADER has been
//! found exactly where this frame's own PLS code said the frame would end. That
//! one check validates both the PLS decode and the frame length, which is what
//! makes ACM safe to follow: a mis-decoded MODCOD predicts the wrong length and
//! the next header is not there. A miss drops back to searching, which is cheap
//! because the correlation for every symbol is already computed — re-acquisition
//! happens on the very next good header.
//!
//! **Carrier recovery** needs none of the above (the correlator and the PLS
//! code are read differentially), so it runs over each frame as the frame is
//! emitted, in stream order: data-aided over the PLHEADER and the pilot blocks
//! (known symbols, so the absolute phase is resolved with no 90° ambiguity)
//! and decision-directed over the data against the frame's own MODCOD
//! constellation, so an ACM carrier stays locked as QPSK, 8PSK and APSK frames
//! alternate. At (re)acquisition the loop is seeded from the two headers that
//! confirmed the first frame: with their modulation removed they are a pure
//! tone at the carrier offset.
