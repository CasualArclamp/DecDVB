//! Physical-layer scrambling (ETSI EN 302 307-1 §5.5.4).
//!
//! The PLFRAME **payload** is randomised by rotating each symbol by a multiple
//! of 90°, drawn from a Gold-code sequence. This spreads the spectrum and stops
//! a repetitive payload producing discrete spectral lines.
//!
//! Two details matter and are easy to get wrong:
//!
//! * The **PLHEADER is not scrambled** — it has to be readable before anything
//!   else is known, and it has its own scrambler on the PLS code.
//! * **Pilot blocks *are* scrambled**, so the payload here means everything
//!   after the PLHEADER, pilots included.
//!
//! The sequence depends only on the gold-code index, so it is computed once up
//! front. Because every factor is exactly ±1 or ±j, scrambling is exact in
//! floating point and a scramble/descramble round trip is bit-identical.
//!
//! Sequence generator ported from `gr-dvbs2rx`'s `lib/pl_descrambler.cc`, which
//! in turn takes it from `gr-dtv`'s `dvbs2_physical_cc_impl.cc` (both GPL-3).
