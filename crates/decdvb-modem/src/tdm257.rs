//! A 128.5 kbit/s TDM multiplex found inside a Q-Flex FastLink carrier's
//! Paradise framing (what feeds the modem's data port; its make is not yet
//! known): 257-bit frames every 2 ms — one alignment bit, then 256 payload
//! bits read as sixteen 16-bit words at 8 kHz, each bit position of the
//! word an 8 kbit/s channel.
//!
//! Alignment bits, one a frame: on alternate frames the 7-bit Barker
//! sequence reversed (0100111) over and over, so a 14-frame (28 ms)
//! cycle; between them 7 data bits a cycle, repeating every 70 frames
//! (140 ms). All of this was found blind on one capture (STATUS.md, "The
//! Q-Flex's 128.5 kbit/s"); no specification is known.
//!
//! Each channel runs in 4 ms subframes: 16 data bits, then a status octet
//! twice (on the signalling channels 00 or FF). A call is G.728 voice at
//! 16 kbit/s spread over four channels, two bits a TDM word: the stream's
//! even bits from one pair of channels' data halves, its odd bits from the
//! other (STATUS.md, "The Q-Flex calls are G.728 too"). One stream bit in
//! 64 is in no channel (one channel's data sits a bit early, over its
//! status), so the decoder takes it as unknown. Which channels, and where
//! their bits go, is learnt from the voice equipment's silence fill — a
//! known 160-bit cycle — while the channels idle: [`Placement`].
//!
//! The receiver finds the frame by the alignment word, then meters every
//! channel: idle codec channels repeat a 160-bit (20 ms) frame, pattern
//! channels a 32-bit (4 ms) one, and speech should show as a channel that
//! stops repeating. Speech changes only the data half of each subframe —
//! about a quarter of the bits from one 20 ms to the next — so a channel
//! once seen idle as a codec counts as active as soon as it departs from
//! its idle frame at all.
